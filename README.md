# gauss.js — math & physics, made playable ✨

This is a hands-on playground for math/physics ideas.
Instead of reading equations only, you *touch* them: sliders, buttons, visual demos, tiny simulations.

**Live playground:** https://kiara-03-lab.github.io/gauss.js/

---

## What is this?
Think: “complex physics, but as simple toys.”

Each demo is a small interactive page that explains one idea:
- vectors & forces (push / pull)
- waves & harmonics
- motion & energy
- fields (gravity / electric-style intuition)
- calculus intuition (slope, area, change)
- probability & randomness
- whatever we build next

---

## How to use
### Online
Open the live playground link and click a demo.

### Local
1. Download / clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
   (or use a local server if you want modules later)

---

## Demos (starting set)
- **Vector Playground** — add arrows, see components and magnitude
- **Wave Playground** — frequency/amplitude/phase with a moving wave
- **Projectile Playground** — gravity + launch angle, see trajectory

More coming as we add modules.

## Philosophy (why this exists)
If you're new: you should be able to learn by *playing*.
If you're advanced: you should be able to extend demos fast.

Rules:
- minimal text, maximum intuition
- sliders > paragraphs
- show the why visually
- keep each demo small and remixable

## Contributing
Want a new demo idea?
Open an issue with:
- concept name
- what users should *feel/learn*
- what controls should exist (sliders/buttons)
